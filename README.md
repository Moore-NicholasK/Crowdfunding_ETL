# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 for Data Viz Class by Judith Cuellar And Nicholas Moore.

##
We worked primarily individually in separate wip (work in progress) files, then sanity checked together.  Then each of us finalized the code for 2 sections of the project and contributed to a single named "ETL_Mini_Project_Nmoore_Jcuellar.ipynb".

Our resulting 4 .csv files can be found in the Resources directory under the names:
* campaign.csv
* category.csv
* subcategory.csv
* contacts.csv

For the SQL portion, we created the database locally with the "crowdfunding_db_schema.sql" file we generated, imported the data and save images of the resulting tables with images stored in the images directory in this repo.  The image of the db schema can be found in the images folder under the name "schema_image".

Thank you!
